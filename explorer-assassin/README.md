** Problem ** 
John is a map maker. He is standing at point `(0,0)` and must explore the area. John can move one space at a time left, right, up or down. If John is standing at `(x, y)`, he can move to `(x+1, y)`, `(x-1, y)`, `(x, y+1)`, or `(x, y-1)`.

Bill is an assassin, and must stop John from exploring. Therefore, Bill decided to plant mines. Bill has placed mines at points where the sum of the absolute value of the coordinate's digits is greater than 21. For example, the point `(59, -79)` has a mine, because `5 + 9 + 7 + 9 > 21`. But the point `(-113, -104)` has no mine because ` 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 4 <= 21 `.

If John steps on a mine he will die, John can not jump over the mines, so he must walk around the mines to avoid them. How many points can John access while making his map, given that he starts at (0, 0)?
